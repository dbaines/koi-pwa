# Koi PWA test app

The aim of this project is to create a playground to implement best practicies for PWA technologies. 

Some of the samples we'll be creating are:

1. [Webpacker workflow for writing in ES2016+](docs/WEBPACKER.md)  
1. [Using credentials API to login to a devise user account with form fallback](docs/CREDENTIALS.md)  
1. [WebShare API with fallback](docs/WEBSHARE.md)  
1. Offline-first application frame 
1. Geolocation workflows 
1. Skeleton elements and loading in content from Koi endpoint via AJAX 
1. Building a service worker using rails
    - Notifications 
    - Workbox integration 

# Notes

A lot of these features only work on secure domains (HTTPS) or localhost.
